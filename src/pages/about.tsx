              <p>
                Before I started this project I was initially looking for ideas
                to help me practice my web dev skills. I wanted to do something
                that combined a topic that matter to me and that other people
                might share an interest on. {"I've"} always been a dog person and
                for a long time {"I've"} been wanting to adopt one but my current
                situation has not allowed for it (...yet).
              </p>
              <p>
                So with that in mind, whenever {"I've"} looked at shelter websites I
                noticed some of them were not the most user friendly. Hence, I
                thought on doing something for our furry friends
                <span role="img" aria-label="dog emoji" className="mx-2">
                  üê∂
                </span>{" "}
                and help them find a forever home
                <span role="img" aria-label="dog emoji" className="mx-2">

                If you too are planning on owning a dog, cat, etc. I encourage
                you to adopt from a shelter instead of shopping/buying. You can
                search online about the many reasons why but below I list what I
                think is the most important one (

                      There are so many reasons to adopt a dog rather than
                      purchase one from a breeder. Every year, an estimated{" "}
                      <strong>
                        1.5 million adoptable shelter dogs and cats are
                        euthanized
                      </strong>{" "}
                      in the U.S., according to the ASPCA ‚Äî that‚Äôs because the
                      shelters simply don‚Äôt have enough space and funding to
                      accommodate all the animals that are brought there.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Every time an animal is adopted, a space opens up in the
                      shelter or the rescue. So when you adopt a cat or dog, not
                      only are you saving that animal‚Äôs life, but you are also
                      opening up a space for another animal‚Äôs life to be saved.
