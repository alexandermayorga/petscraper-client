              I started this project wanting to combine a topic that matter to
              me, that other people shared an interest on, and my web dev
              skills. As I brainstormed on this I ended up thinking about dogs,
              adopting a pet, and local shelters. I remembered that whenever{" "}
              {"I've"} looked at shelter websites I noticed some of them were
              not the most user friendly. I also {"didn't"} want to looked at
              every local website shelter when browsing the web.
              {/* Before I started this project I was initially looking for ideas to
              help me practice my web dev skills. I wanted to do something that
              combined a topic that matter to me and that other people might
              share an interest on. {"I've"} always been a dog person and for a
              long time {"I've"} been wanting to adopt one but my current
              situation has not allowed for it (...yet). */}

              So with that in mind, I thought on doing something that will help
              future pet owners with their search as well as helping our furry
              friends

              If you too are planning on owning a dog, cat, etc. I encourage you
              to adopt from a shelter instead of shopping/buying. You can search
              online about the many reasons why but below I list what I think is
              the most important one (
              <a href="https://www.greenmatters.com/p/why-adopt-dont-shop">
                link to article

                  <p>
                    There are so many reasons to adopt a dog rather than
                    purchase one from a breeder. Every year, an estimated{" "}
                    <strong>
                      1.5 million adoptable shelter dogs and cats are euthanized
                    </strong>{" "}
                    in the U.S., according to the ASPCA ‚Äî that‚Äôs because the
                    shelters simply don‚Äôt have enough space and funding to
                    accommodate all the animals that are brought there.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Every time an animal is adopted, a space opens up in the
                    shelter or the rescue. So when you adopt a cat or dog, not
                    only are you saving that animal‚Äôs life, but you are also
                    opening up a space for another animal‚Äôs life to be saved.
